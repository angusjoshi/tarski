should revisit the shapley eps plots
size = 3 is useless because it just runs the inner algorithm for chen li and fearnley pav savani
throughout max entry in shapley payoff matrices is 10.
varying epsilon vs max entry doesn't matter

all normal plots are epsilon = 0.01, beta = 0.01 (contraction = 1 - beta).

test protocol is as follows
  for arrival, 
    just test with different sizes all the algorithms, 
    so a separate test for the walk with bigger sizes

  for shapley,
    test all algorithms with fixed epsilon, varying size
    test all algorithms with fixed size (4?), varying epsilon
    test iterate separately?

  for simple,
    test all algorithms with fixed epsilon, varying size
    test all algorithms with fixed size (9?), varying epsilon
    test iterate separately?


epsilon test is as follows
  simple test size is fixed 11
  shapley test size is 3
