In particular, we design an algorithm that finds a fixed point of f when it is given (L,⪯) as input and f as an oracle. Our algorithm makes O(log∣L∣) queries to f when ⪯ is a total order on L. We also prove that when both f and (L,⪯) are given as oracles, any deterministic or randomized algorithm for finding a fixed point of f makes an expected Ω(∣L∣) queries for some (L,⪯) and f.}

    abstract = { We reexamine what it means to compute Nash equilibria and, more generally, what it means to compute a fixed point of a given Brouwer function, and we investigate the complexity of the associated problems. Specifically, we study the complexity of the following problem: given a finite game, \$\Gamma\$, with 3 or more players, and given \$\epsilon>0\$, compute an approximation within \$\epsilon\$ of some (actual) Nash equilibrium. We show that approximation of an actual Nash equilibrium, even to within any nontrivial constant additive factor \$\epsilon<1/2\$ in just one desired coordinate, is at least as hard as the long-standing square-root sum problem, as well as a more general arithmetic circuit decision problem that characterizes P-time in a unit-cost model of computation with arbitrary precision rational arithmetic; thus, placing the approximation problem in P, or even NP, would resolve major open problems in the complexity of numerical computation. We show similar results for market equilibria: it is hard to estimate with any nontrivial accuracy the equilibrium prices in an exchange economy with a unique equilibrium, where the economy is given by explicit algebraic formulas for the excess demand functions. We define a class, FIXP, which captures search problems that can be cast as fixed point computation problems for functions represented by algebraic circuits (straight line programs) over basis \$\{+,*,-,/,\max,\min\}\$ with rational constants. We show that the (exact or approximate) computation of Nash equilibria for 3 or more players is complete for FIXP. The price equilibrium problem for exchange economies with algebraic demand functions is another FIXP-complete problem. We show that the piecewise linear fragment of FIXP equals PPAD. Many other problems in game theory, economics, and probability theory can be cast as fixed point problems for such algebraic functions. We discuss several important such problems: computing the value of Shapley's stochastic games and the simpler games of Condon, extinction probabilities of branching processes, probabilities of stochastic context-free grammars, and termination probabilities of recursive Markov chains. We show that for some of them, the approximation, or even exact computation, problem can be placed in PPAD, while for others, they are at least as hard as the square-root sum and arithmetic circuit decision problems. }

abstract = {The study of simple stochastic games (SSGs) was initiated by Condon for analyzing the computational power of randomized space-bounded alternating Turing machines. The game is played by two players, MAX and MIN, on a directed multigraph, and when the play terminates at a sink vertex s, MAX wins from MIN a payoff p(s)∈[0,1]. Condon proved that the problem SSG-VALUE—given a SSG, determine whether the expected payoff won by MAX is greater than 1/2 when both players use their optimal strategies—is in NP∩coNP. However, the exact complexity of this problem remains open, as it is not known whether the problem is in P or is hard for some natural complexity class. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of a strategy improvement algorithm by Hoffman and Karp for this problem. The Hoffman–Karp algorithm converges to optimal strategies of a given SSG, but no non-trivial bounds were previously known on its running time. We prove a bound of O(2n/n) on the convergence time of the Hoffman–Karp algorithm, and a bound of O(20.78n) on a randomized variant. These are the first non-trivial upper bounds on the convergence time of these strategy improvement algorithms.}

 abstract = {A stochastic game is played in a sequence of steps; at each step the play is said to be in some state i, chosen from a finite collection of states. If the play is in state i, the first player chooses move k and the second player chooses move l, then the first player receives a reward akli, and, with probability pklij, the next state is j. The concept of stochastic games was introduced by Shapley with the proviso that, with probability 1, play terminates. The authors consider the case when play never terminates, and show properties of such games and offer a convergent algorithm for their solution. In the special case when one of the players is a dummy, the nonterminating stochastic game reduces to a Markovian decision process, and the present work can be regarded as the extension to a game theoretic context of known results on Markovian decision processes.},

abstract = {A new algorithm called Mersenne Twister (MT) is proposed for generating uniform pseudorandom numbers. For a particular choice of parameters, the algorithm provides a super astronomical period of 219937 −1 and 623-dimensional equidistribution up to 32-bit accuracy, while using a working area of only 624 words. This is a new variant of the previously proposed generators, TGFSR, modified so as to admit a Mersenne-prime period. The characteristic polynomial has many terms. The distribution up to v bits accuracy for 1 ≤ v ≤ 32 is also shown to be good. An algorithm is also given that checks the primitivity of the characteristic polynomial of MT with computational complexity O(p2) where p is the degree of the polynomial.We implemented this generator in portable C-code. It passed several stringent statistical tests, including diehard. Its speed is comparable to other modern generators. Its merits are due to the efficient algorithms that are unique to polynomial calculations over the two-element field.},
