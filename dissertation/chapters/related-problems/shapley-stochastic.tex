\section{Shapley's Stochastic Games}
Shapley's stochastic games, or just stochastic games,
can be seen as a more general framework than simple stochastic games.
As described in \citep{shapley}, a stochastic game is roughly speaking
a set of game states, where at each stage two players choose from
a set of action. Based on the joint action chosen and the state the game is in
the two players receive a payoff which sums to zero, and
the game transitions to another state chosen randomly from a distribution
associated with the joint action and the state. The game then halts
with some positive probability, and if it did not then the process repeats.

  \caption{The goal of the arrival problem is to decide whether a partiular walk on a directed graph with a particular
  structure reaches the target. On successive visits to a particular
  vertex the outgoing edge taken alternates. In this example
  the walk begins $s \to v_1 \to v_4 \to s \to v_3 \to \ldots$.}
