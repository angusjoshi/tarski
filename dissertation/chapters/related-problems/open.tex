\section{Open Problems}
The key open problems relating to this chapter are whether or not polynomial-time
algorithms exist for any of the described problems.
\begin{open}
  Is $\arr$ in \PClass?
\end{open}
\begin{open}
  Is computing the exact value of a simple stochastic game in \PClass?
\end{open}
\begin{open}
  Is approximating the value of shapley's stochastic games to any $\varepsilon \in \rpos$
  in \PClass?
\end{open}
All of these problems have seen a significant amount of study in years gone by.
That answers have not been found, and they are all reducible to $\trsk$ places
$\trsk$ in an interesting position in the complexity landscape of algorithmic game theory,
and perhaps motivates further study on the problem.
