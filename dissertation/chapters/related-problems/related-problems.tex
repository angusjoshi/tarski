\chapter{Related Problems} \label{relatedProblemsChapter}
In this chapter, I discuss three problems problems in algorithmic game theory
which are polynomial-time reducible to $\trsk$; $\arr$, simple stochastic games, and
shapley's stochastic games, with the goal of motivating study on the $\trsk$ problem.
