\chapter{Testing the Algorithms}

\section{Overview}
While the algorithms of previous sections are of great theoretical interest,
questions remain on their practicality. To address this,
I have implemented the algorithms and tested their performance on
randomly generated instances of $\arr$, simple stochastic games, and
shapley's stochastic games. The notable conclusions are roughly speaking as follows,
\begin{itemize}
  \item the most basic \cref{kleeneTarski} outperforms all of the
more complex algorithms in all cases in terms of query count and time,
\item the least performant algorithm in all cases is found to be \cref{dQiYiAlg} in both
  query count and time,
  \item the fixpoint decomposition method described in \cref{fixDecompChapter} performs better than the asymptotically superior
monotone decomposition method described in \cref{monotoneDecompChap}.
\end{itemize}
