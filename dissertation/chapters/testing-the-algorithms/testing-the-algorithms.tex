\section{Overview}
While the algorithms of previous sections are of great theoretical interest,
questions remain on their practicality. To address this,
I have implemented the algorithms and tested their performance on
randomly generated instances of $ \arr $, simple stochastic games, and
shapley's stochastic games. The notable conclusions are roughly speaking as follows,
\begin{itemize}
  \item the most basic algorithms of value iteration, and simulating the $\arr$ walk outperform all of the
binary search style algorithms in almost all cases in terms of query count and time,
\item \cref{fixDecompAlg} of Fearnley, \pav, and Savani 
  tends to be the most performant of the binary search style algorithms on the problems tested
  here,
  \item the fixpoint decomposition method described in \cref{fixDecompChapter} performs better than the asymptotically superior
monotone decomposition method described in \cref{monotoneDecompChap}.
\end{itemize}
