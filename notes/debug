the problem is:
  the directions returned by the slice function are not in the right order maybe?

sketch of width zero:
  witness on edge of the of the small side is bad. need to preprocess this.
    if corner is monotone in the slice then we can delete witness.
    if the second point is monotone in the slice then we can restrict to the width-zero instance
    u <= d implies that if there is a witness on the other side, it is not on the opposite edge.

    the core idea here is that when they point towards eachother, there is
    guaranteed to be a fixpoint in the dimension in between them, and since there
    are no points in between them one of them is that fixpoint.

  after witnesses are fixed, we do two runs of the normal helper
  EXCEPT use floor division by two in first, ceil in second. (for everything)
  if the instance shrinks due to this, good. go next.
  if not,
    





  note step 1 is the fixing the witnesses to be not beyond halfway,
  step 2 is the query mid etc.
