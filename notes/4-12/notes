notes from meeting with kousha,
  monotone up points with all dimensions fixed except one are not interesting because you can
  define for a general monotone function a similar function with the same fixpoints etc. as before.

  the iterative algorithm starting from the bottom is just the walk on the graph.
  could be worth trying to work out what the iterative algorithm starting from the top is.

  have a look at feedback vertex sets. in particular, with respect to monotone functions from the arrival instance
  on the entire instance, what can be said about 'slicing' at things like a small feedback vertex set.
  have a look at the section in the subexp paper about this as well.

  see if there are any other interesting properties of dags that i can slice at etc.


  this property that a function usually moves up one 'level set' is supposedly interesting
  have a look at this? mainly the 'asymmetry' in how it moves up very little but can mvoe down a lot

  a result which says that
