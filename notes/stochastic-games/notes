need some vertices
  a start and two sinks (0 and 1)
  rest are partitioned into max, min, chance
  max and min nodes just have successors
  chance nodes have successors with weights such that the weights sum to one.
  
  equations are 

  i'll just put last as 0 sink, second last as one sink, first as source.


F^\beta(x)_i = (1 - \beta)F(x)

this is a contraction map w.r.t. lp norm as,
\| (1 - \beta)F(x) - (1 - \beta)F(y) \| = (1 - \beta)\|F(x) - F(y)\|

why is \|F(x) - F(y)\| \leq \|x - y\|?


shapley:
  an instance of shapley is G = (V, A, P, s). 
  V = {v_1, ..., v_n}
  A = {A^1, ..., A^n} are the reward matrices at v_i
  P = (P^i_{j, k}) is a collection of vectors of probabilities,
    representing the transition probs given players play j, k at v_i.
    
    further note i require P^i_{j, k}(r) >= 0 and sum P < 1 (note STRICT inequality)

  s \in V is the start vertex.

  q^i_{j, k} = 1 - sum_r  P^i_{j, k} > 0 is the probability
    with which the games halts immediately
    given an action profile and vertex.

  q = min_{i, j, k} q^i_{j, k} is the min of such probabilities.
  we require q > 0 by assumption.
