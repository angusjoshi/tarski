need some vertices
  a start and two sinks (0 and 1)
  rest are partitioned into max, min, chance
  max and min nodes just have successors
  chance nodes have successors with weights such that the weights sum to one.
  
  equations are 

  i'll just put last as 0 sink, second last as one sink, first as source.


F^\beta(x)_i = (1 - \beta)F(x)

this is a contraction map w.r.t. lp norm as,
\| (1 - \beta)F(x) - (1 - \beta)F(y) \| = (1 - \beta)\|F(x) - F(y)\|

why is \|F(x) - F(y)\| \leq \|x - y\|?
