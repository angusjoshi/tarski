# tarski

Algorithms for solving the `Tarski` problem. That is, algorithms for finding fixpoints of monotone functions `f : [N]^d -> [N]^d`
on bounded sublattices of the integer lattice. Applications of `Tarski` to problems in game theory are also included.

## Requirements
`CMake >= 3.26`

google `or-tools`

`Boost >= 1.84.0`

## Usage
The following commands will build and run some analyses of the algorithms on assorted problems.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/angusjoshi/tarski
$ cd tarski/src
$ cmake .
$ ./src
```




created for my dissertation.
